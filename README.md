Accounts System V1.1

This account system is based off MySQL and saves pretty much all the needed stuff you require in a login/register system.

With a basic look, this script should do for anyone that is starting a server and wants to use a accounts system which doesn't use MTA's and uses MySQL.

Coming soon:
Password recovery, account management and some other stuff.

NOTE: Extract everything from the .zip file and upload the SQL file to your database.
